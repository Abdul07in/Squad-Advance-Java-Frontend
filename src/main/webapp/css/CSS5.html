	<p id="box1">Java has been one of the most popular programming
		languages for many years.<br>Java is Object Oriented. However, it is not
		considered as pure object-oriented as it provides support for
		primitive data types (like int, char, etc) The Java codes are first
		compiled into byte code (machine-independent code). <br>Then the byte code
		runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying
		architecture.<br> Java syntax is similar to C/C++. But Java does not
		provide low-level programming functionalities like pointers. Also,
		Java codes are always written in the form of classes and objects. <br>Java
		is used in all kinds of applications like Mobile Applications (Android
		is Java-based), desktop applications, web applications, client-server
		applications, enterprise applications, and many more. When compared
		with C++, Java codes are generally more maintainable because Java does
		not allow many things which may lead to bad/inefficient programming if
		used incorrectly. <br>For example, non-primitives are always references in
		Java. So we cannot pass large objects (like we can do in C++) to
		functions, we always pass references in Java. <br>One more example, since
		there are no pointers, bad memory access is also not possible. When
		compared with Python, Java kind of fits between C++ and Python.<br> The
		programs are written in Java typically run faster than corresponding
		Python programs and slower than C++.<br> Like C++, Java does static type
		checking, but Python does not.</p>
